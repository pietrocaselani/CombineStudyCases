# Introduction to Combine and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming)
 
## Why FRP?

 * Less mutability. More control over state changes
 * Async operations
 * Encapsulate side effects
 * Handling multiple events (mouse movement, buttons taps, state changes)

 ## Combine

Combine is a framework from Apple that provides a declarative API for processing values over time.
