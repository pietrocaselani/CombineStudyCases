 While this translation works fine, we have a few gotchas.

 Future is eager evaluated

 This means if we have the following code,

 ```
 Future<Int, Never> { completion in
     print(">>> 42 from Future")
     completion(.success(42))
 }
 ```

 We will see 42 printed in the console, even that we haven't "sinked" into this publisher.

 We can "fix" that by using yet another publisher, `Deferred`
